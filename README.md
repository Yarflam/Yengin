# Yengin

Yengin@next version 3 - compatible Node.js / Frameworks JS / Native JS.

## In progress

Objectives: I want to give you libs/tools and some (React) components reusables. Retroversion of features is assured a minimum (much less the implementation).

~~ Nothing has changed now, I'm preparing the rebuild before merge to dev branch (replace 2.1.6:dev) ~~
